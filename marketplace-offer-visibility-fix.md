# 🛒 Marketplace Offer Visibility Fix

## **✅ Problem Solved**
Fixed the issue where offers were disappearing from the marketplace immediately after purchase, even when there was still quantity available.

## **🔍 Root Cause Analysis**

The marketplace was filtering out offers too aggressively. The original logic was:

1. **❌ Problem**: Offers with ANY pending purchases were hidden from marketplace
2. **❌ Problem**: This happened regardless of remaining quantity
3. **❌ Problem**: Multiple buyers couldn't purchase from the same offer

### **Original Filtering Logic (Problematic)**
```typescript
// This was filtering out offers with pending purchases
const pendingOfferIds = purchases
  .filter(purchase => 
    purchase.status === 'pending' || 
    purchase.status === 'approved' || 
    purchase.paymentApprovalStatus === 'pending'
  )
  .map(purchase => purchase.offerId);

// This removed offers from marketplace too early
filteredOffers = filteredOffers.filter(offer => 
  !pendingOfferIds.includes(offer.id)
);
```

## **🔧 Solution Implemented**

### **New Filtering Logic (Fixed)**
```typescript
// Only filter out offers that are truly unavailable
filteredOffers = filteredOffers.filter(offer => 
  offer.status !== 'sold' && 
  !offer.deleted &&
  offer.quantity > 0
);
```

### **Key Changes Made**

#### **1. Updated `getOffers` Function** (`src/services/firebaseService.ts`)
- ✅ Removed aggressive pending purchase filtering
- ✅ Added quantity > 0 filter
- ✅ Only hide offers when truly sold out or deleted

#### **2. Updated `getOffersBySupplierId` Function** (`src/services/firebaseService.ts`)
- ✅ Applied same filtering logic to company profile pages
- ✅ Updated both main query and fallback query

#### **3. Enhanced `updateOfferAfterPurchase` Function**
- ✅ Already correctly updates quantity and status
- ✅ Marks as 'sold' only when quantity reaches 0
- ✅ Keeps status as 'active' when quantity > 0

## **🔄 New Purchase Flow**

### **Before Purchase:**
1. Offer appears in marketplace with full quantity
2. Multiple buyers can see and purchase the same offer

### **During Purchase:**
1. Buyer purchases quantity (e.g., 50 out of 100)
2. Purchase record created with status 'pending'
3. **✅ Offer remains visible in marketplace** (NEW!)

### **After Purchase:**
1. `updateOfferAfterPurchase` reduces quantity (100 → 50)
2. Offer status remains 'active' (since quantity > 0)
3. **✅ Offer continues to appear in marketplace** (NEW!)
4. Other buyers can still purchase remaining quantity

### **When Completely Sold Out:**
1. Quantity reaches 0
2. Status changes to 'sold'
3. **✅ Offer disappears from marketplace** (CORRECT!)

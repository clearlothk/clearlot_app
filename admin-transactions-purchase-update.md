# 🎯 Admin Transactions Page - Purchase Integration Update

## **✅ Problem Solved**
The admin Transactions Management page now shows purchases after payment success, using the correct `purchases` collection instead of the `transactions` collection.

## **🔧 Changes Made**

### **1. Enhanced Firebase Service** (`src/services/firebaseService.ts`)

#### **New Function: `getAllPurchasesForAdmin`**
- Fetches all purchases from the `purchases` collection
- Orders by `purchaseDate` in descending order
- Returns `Purchase[]` array for admin display

#### **Updated Purchase Status**
- Purchase status is now updated to `'completed'` after successful payment
- Both top-level `status` and `paymentDetails.status` are updated

### **2. Updated Purchase Modal** (`src/components/PurchaseModal.tsx`)

#### **Enhanced Purchase Completion**
- Added `updateDoc` import for Firestore updates
- After successful payment, purchase status is updated to `'completed'`
- Both `status` and `paymentDetails.status` fields are updated

### **3. Completely Refactored Admin Transactions Page** (`src/components/AdminTransactionsPage.tsx`)

#### **Updated Data Source**
- Changed from `getAllTransactions()` to `getAllPurchasesForAdmin()`
- Updated imports to use `Purchase` type instead of `Transaction`
- Updated all state variables to use `Purchase` type

#### **Updated Filtering Logic**
- Modified search to use `offerId`, `buyerId`, `sellerId` instead of company names
- Updated status filtering to use Purchase status fields
- Simplified approval status filtering

#### **Updated Sorting Logic**
- Changed default sort from `'transactionDate'` to `'purchaseDate'`
- Updated amount sorting to use `finalAmount`
- Updated date sorting to use `purchaseDate` and `paymentDetails.timestamp`

#### **Updated Table Display**
- **Offer Information**: Shows `offerId` instead of `offerTitle`
- **Amount Display**: Shows `unitPrice`, `platformFee`, `finalAmount`
- **Status Display**: Shows Purchase `status` and `paymentDetails.status`
- **Date Display**: Shows `purchaseDate` instead of `transactionDate`
- **User Information**: Shows `buyerId` and `sellerId` instead of company names

#### **Updated Modal Content**
- **Receipt Modal**: Updated to show Purchase fields and receipt preview
- **Approval Modal**: Updated to work with Purchase data structure
- **Receipt Viewing**: Direct link to receipt preview URL

## **🔄 How It Works**

### **Purchase Flow:**
1. User completes purchase and uploads receipt
2. Purchase is saved to `purchases` collection with `status: 'pending'`
3. After payment verification, status is updated to `'completed'`
4. Admin can view all purchases in Transactions Management page

### **Admin View:**
1. Admin navigates to Transactions Management
2. Page fetches all purchases from `purchases` collection
3. Displays purchases with status, amounts, and receipt links
4. Admin can view receipts and manage purchase status

## **🔍 Technical Implementation**

```

### **Collection Structure:**
